# hn-w3-template

This repository is the template for my website. I stole most of the internals from [Jan de Caluwe's **Urubu Quickstart** repository](https://github.com/jandecaluwe/urubu-quickstart)

## Installing
The repository is first installed locally. Then the website is built and uploaded to the hosting website.
```
git clone <URL>
cd hn-w3-template
_bin\pushwww.sh .
```
