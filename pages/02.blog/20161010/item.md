title: QEMU/KVM set-up (after installation)
date: 10/10/2016

To find the optimal distro for my VMs, I want to do some tests.  This requires me to install
each distro various times over the course of the next couple of months. To be able to distinguish between
the various distributions I thought I'd use a default hostname per distro and use a trailing number as
an indicator of its installation incarnation. "Normal" servers on my LAN are assigned names based on
the names of elementary particles. Hostnames of clients are either chosen by their owner, user or based on
the names of chemical elements.

For testing distros I will use female names that start with the same letter(s) as the distro.

| OS name | default hostname |
| ------- | ------- |
| Debian  | debbie  |
| Fedora  | fiona   |
| CentOS  | cindy   |
| openSUSE | susie  |
| Mageia  | maggie |
